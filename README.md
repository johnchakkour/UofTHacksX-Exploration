# UofTHacksX-Exploration
Our* project for UofTHacks X. 

In line with this year's theme, "exploration", we have decided to make a website for people to find nearby events to attend: from house parties, karaoke, nightclub events, concerts... anything, really.

Our goal is to have the UI consist of embedded Google Maps (or a Google Maps clone), with markers placed by users advertising their events. The markers would contain information such as the name of the host, the location, and optional keywords or tags.

We also plan on having an option to generate a short description for an event from the keywords using the Cohere API.

This README file will be updated periodically.
