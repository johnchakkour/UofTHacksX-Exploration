# UofTHacksX-Exploration
A project for UofTHacks X by @johnchakkour, @IrhaAli, @DarrenPorciello and @SophieLiu071117.

In line with this year's theme, "exploration", we have decided to make a website for people to find nearby events to attend: from house parties, karaoke, nightclub events, concerts... anything, really.

Our goal is to have the UI consist of embedded Google Maps (or a Google Maps clone), with markers placed by users advertising their events. The markers would contain information such as the name of the host, the location, and optional keywords or tags.

## Features we would like to add
- The navigation bar at the top is just a button on the right (like the github one) and when clicked on it shows all the options.
